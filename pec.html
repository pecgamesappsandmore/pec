<p>Welcome to PEC</p>
<p>
Pec Enterprises, founded in summer 2014 has never failed to provide awesome games and apps for its visitors.
 We work as hard as we can to provide the best we can but sadly Pec cannot produce the best games in the world.
 Also the Pec server dose not load as quickly as we would like it to (sometimes it can take up to ½ a minute for everything to appear).
 Pec also allows its visitors to add their games (if they are made on scratch) to our <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/studios/917110/">PEC Pending</a> studio and if we like them we might put them on our website.
 You can also remix any of our games which can be found on the main Pec studio, <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/studios/559530/">Pec Enterprises</a>, which also includes some games that have not yet been uploaded to the main website.
 PEC is a free, 100 % nature friendly company that is run by guys for computer entertainment medias
 e.g games, animations,  music and much more.we also have an ideas and innovation department for new ideas e.g new nature friendly transports.
 we try to make 0 profit and any profit that is made will go to either charity or to make PEC better.
